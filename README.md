Externaly generated plots in publications suck! 
* The font styles/sizes in externally generated figures do not match with the publication. 
* It is hard to resize/rescale the figures without stretching the text in them, 
* It is not easy to style the figures like changing the color or thickness of just one line without leaving your text editor.

Well, that is over now. Just paste your naked numbers in one of our templates and you will be in plotting heaven!
