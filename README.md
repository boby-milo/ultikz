# UltikZ
Ultimate LaTeX template with easily customizable TikZ plot examples of the most commonly used figures in scientific publications!

## Checkout our [example.pdf](https://github.com/millovanovic/ultikz/blob/master/example.pdf)!

Externaly generated plots in publications suck! 
* The font styles/sizes in externally generated figures typically do not match with the publication style. 
* It is hard to resize/rescale the figures without stretching the text in them. 
* It is not easy to style the figures like changing the color or thickness of just one line in the plot without leaving the text editor.

Well, that is over now. Just paste your naked numbers in one of our templates and you will be in plotting heaven! This is all made possible thanks to the amazing [PGFPlots](https://ctan.org/pkg/pgfplots) package for LaTeX and we aim to make it more accessible by providing well commented and highly customizable templates that can be easily tailored to everyone's need.
